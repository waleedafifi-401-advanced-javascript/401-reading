# React Native

***React Native*** is an exciting framework that enables web developers to create robust mobile applications using their existing JavaScript knowledge. It offers faster mobile development, and more efficient code sharing across iOS, Android, and the Web, without sacrificing the end user's experience or application quality.

In **Reactjs**, virtual DOM is used to render browser code in Reactjs while in **React Native**, native APIs are used to render components in mobile. The apps developed with Reactjs renders HTML in UI while React Native uses JSX for rendering UI, which is nothing but javascript.

**Many platforms**, one React. Create platform-specific versions of components so a single codebase can share code across platforms. With React Native, one team can maintain two platforms and share a common technology—React.

1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
- The idea behind "Ducks" is to create a file structure that is scalable and easy to follow. Ducks file structure says that the Redux components (reducers, actions, types) live with the components they're dealing with. The Redux Toolkit deals more with the simplification of writing those Redux components themselves.

2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit?
- It seems that the main advantage of Redux Toolkit is that it includes utility functions that simplify the most common Redux use cases for you (store setup, defining reducers, etc)


## Vocabulary
| **Term**	| **Definition** |
| ----- | ---------- |
| **redux toolkit slices**	| function that accepts initial state, object full of reducer functions, and a slice name and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state |
| **namespace**	 | used for the purpose of grouping symbols and identifiers are a particular functionality and to avoid name collisions between multiple identifiers that share the same name |
