# Component Based UI

1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
   - Vue 
   - Angular 
   - Ember 
   - Preact 
   - Svelte. 

2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
   - library has set functions already outlined that an app can call to perform a task, while a framework defines how an app is designed. A framework will call on the app code vs the other way around like in a library. 


**Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?**
  - Its interesting that when you are using a library, you had access to a method.  When using a framework, it controls the method.  
  - It seems like framworks are a little bit striclty managed to use, rather than framworks.
  - Framworks seem like they are the studs and foundation of the house.  It cannot change very easliy.  Libraries were tools to build the house in the way that you wanted to build them.  

**Which 2 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?**
  - I'm really excited to see what the front end looks like again.  It seems like its been so long since I have seen any of the front end. 
  - I'm also excited to see whether or not the framworks have built in scaffolding, or if the the dev has to build up a lot of the functionality. 

**What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?**
  - I'm really excited to see the way in which the methods are called when using the framworks. 



## Vocabulary

|    **Term**    | **Definition**  |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Rendering | in React this only happens when necessary because its only thinking about how UI should look at any given moment |
| Templating | React uses JSX which is similar to a templating language but "comes with full power of Javascript"|
| State | where your app is at any moment in time. as it relates to React, there is a built in state object and when the state object changes, that specific component re-renders  |
