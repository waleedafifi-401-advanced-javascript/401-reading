# How to Solve Programming Problems

The most common problem when a programmer been asked in an interview about programming problem thee first thing that think about how o code it not how to describee the problem and the solution for it, for example programmer can explain it using pesudo, for example if wee need to reverse the word **Waleed** it can be done as thee list below:

1. First write the word that need to be reversed **Waleed**
2. Write the letter **d** because it is the last letter in thee word
3. Write the letter **e** because it is the second letter from the end.
4. etc.

Also you need to read the problem at least 2-3 times to maak sure you completly understand what the problem is.

You can write a comments it will ehelp you if you forget aany step to solvee thee problem like below
```
// NewWord = “”

// Loop backwards through word to reverse

//   NewWord += CurrentLetter

// Return NewWord

```

Convert the pesodu or the comments to code to try the solution you came up with and try to optemize it aftr it works perfectly

```
String newWord =""
for(int index = oldWord.Length – 1; index <= 0; index—)
   newWord += oldWord[index];
return newWord;
```

Everyone knows that is the Interview is kinds of war so try to win that war, at least try to get out with the least damage you can get.

# I make $1000 each hour

## Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000.

Pretend that you make 1000 USD pr hour if you wast your time by something called I am busy, I don't think the busy person can be a successful person because most successful people I heard of are not busy but they are focused.

Busyness and Stress Are the Enemies when you are not focused so you are wasting your time to solve a problem that takes hours from your time but it can take a minute to figure out what is the best solution for that problem, and being busy is a form of laziness, so never be busy but be focused.

# How to think like a programmer

### Know Yourself
Developers have a reputation of being “the brains” of modern business. But even the most well-rounded, adept devs may have blind spots in their expertise. A dev of sound mind is honest with themselves about what they can and can’t do. When they articulate their strengths, they know exactly what they can offer a project. And if they’re honest about their limitations, they avoid setting false expectations, and can identify the gaps in their knowledge they need to fill.

### Set Goals
Before a dev makes a single keystroke, a project management team has scoped out and designed their application in careful detail. While a dev can go to work without charting a project’s purpose and objectives, they’re more mindful and effective when they’re clear what goal they’re trying to achieve. Good programmers have a strong grip on the roadmap of their project. Even if some of the details in the process get changed or removed altogether, having the game plan top-of-mind helps them focus their efforts more suitably.

### Adopt a Problem-Solving Mindset
Daily existence basically consists of a series of problems to be unraveled and resolved. Some are minor and barely worth mentioning. Others are major and throw your daily schedule into turmoil. A developer’s very nature is attuned to be a problem-solver in every phase of their pipeline. If they don’t have a reliable, ready-made solution at hand, it’s their job to go find one. The problem-solving mindset is used to observe, demystify, diagnose and resolve puzzles with minimum drama.

### Break Things
Error is permanently built into programmer and startup culture. The thinking is that, if you want to learn how something is constructed, break it on purpose and put it back together. Whether they’re building an app from scratch or simulating errors in bug bashes, devs test their abilities by deconstructing processes, knowingly committing errors, or flat-out ruining certain processes before they’re ready to ship. They run tests they know will fail or simulate events they know will wreak some havoc. Although that’s not a suggestion that you take a 2-by-4 to a server and indulge your worst nature, you could do some mildly cruel things to JavaScript and find your way out of it.

### Always Grow and Never Stop Learning
This maxim goes for anyone seeking to become an expert in anything, but web development offers quite a few more opportunities to live this proverb out than most other disciplines. The most insightful and crafty programmers know that change is the only constant in technology: No matter how thoroughly they’ve mastered their craft, there are new systems, technologies and languages waiting just around the corner. Instead of being discouraged by the impossibility of knowing it all, they’ve accepted that they’ll spend the rest of their careers learning and growing with the industry.

### Stay Positive
If you’ve ever viewed the source code of a major entity’s website, you’ve seen just how sprawling and indecipherable it is to the naked eye. Yet the people responsible for generating that mass of code aren’t super-machines that appeared on Earth after a solar eclipse. They’re suspiciously similar to you and me. Professional web developers (even the surly ones) have a positive approach to their work. They’ve embraced challenge in their own way and see it as a normal part of a healthy human life.

# Why?

Always ask **why** about everything like why the problem is occurring? to get to know about any problem just ask why and lots of answers will get in front of you to solve any problem, and one last thing knows when you have to stop, when the way you think of no more useful, and you can go no further.
