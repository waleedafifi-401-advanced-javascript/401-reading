# Event Driven Applications

### What is access control important?
Access control is important because it's a scalable way to restrict and permit access to certain areas of the platform.  

### Describe an application that would need access control.
An example of an application that might need access control is a trading platform used at a financial planning company. It would be important to restrict user's capabilities based on their role at the company- the financial planner themselves would want the ability to go in and actually process trades, whereas someone on the administrative staff might just need the ability to log in and see that those trades had occurred (vs being able to submit them themselves).  

### What is a role used for?
A role is used to tell the application what exactly that particular user has access to. It's the way the program is able to restrict access based on a certain input. 

### Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
Discretionary access control lets each user control what they have access to and mandatory access control has the system doing it, whereas role based access control is a scalable and real-world way to strucutre control and a user's job function.
