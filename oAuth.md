# OAuth

__Why is authentication important?__  
This is an important part of protecting a users info. If we do not use good authentication, then the wrong people could sign into other user accounts.

__Why should we be careful about storing a userâ€™s password?__  
It is important becuase a user might have sensitive information that they are storing on the site or app. By asking for sensitive information, it is important to be responsible with the passwords to keep the users safe.  

__What is the difference between hashing and encryption?__  
Something that is encrypted can be decrypted. Something that is hashed cannot be unhashed, it is a one way function. Hashing is more secure than encryption.

__What is the difference between encryption and encoding?__   
Encoding can be reversed by the same algorithm, but encryption needs a key to be reversed, so encryption is more secure than encoding.
